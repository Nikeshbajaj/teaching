# A Quick Start with SVM [~3min]
In this notebook, we explain to download the dataset and getting started with all the predictive tasks using Support Vector Machine. We will be extracting spectral features, specifically 6 rhythmic features - total power in 6 frequency bands, namely, Delta (0.5-4 Hz), Theta (4-8 Hz), Alpha (8-14 Hz), Beta (14-30 Hz), Low Gamma (30-47 Hz), and High Gamma (47-64 Hz). For preprocessing, we filter EEG first with 0.5 Hz highpass and then remove Artifact with ICA based approach.
